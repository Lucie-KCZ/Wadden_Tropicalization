# Community Tropicalisation Explorer üåç 

Welcome to the **Community Tropicalisation Explorer**!  
This project provides a complete workflow to analyse, visualise, and understand how marine communities respond to climate change, focusing on **Community Temperature Index (CTI)** dynamics and their ecological drivers.

It includes:
- An easy-to-use **Shiny web application**.
- A full set of **R scripts for manual analysis**.
- Supporting tools for **sea surface temperature (SST) data extraction and processing**.

## Ecological background and purpose

Marine communities are shifting under climate change.  
Community responses can include:

- **Tropicalisation** (gain of warm-affinity species)
- **Borealisation** (gain of cold-affinity species)
- **Deborealisation** (loss of cold-affinity species)
- **Detropicalisation** (loss of warm-affinity species)

Tracking CTI over time, and decomposing the processes behind it, is essential for monitoring biodiversity resilience, identifying hotspots of change, and informing management strategies.

This project aims to **make CTI analysis accessible and reproducible** for ecologists, conservation practitioners, and stakeholders.

## üöÄ How to use this project

### 1. Quick Start ‚Äî Launch the Shiny App

1. Clone or download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucie-KCZ/Wadden_Tropicalization.git
cd Wadden_Tropicalization/App
```

2. Install required R packages:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "leaflet", "shinyFiles", "ggplot2", "terra",
  "nlme", "ggeffects", "scales", "dplyr", "leaflet.minicharts"
))
```

3. Run the app:

```r
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

or open `App/app.R` in RStudio and click **Run App**,
or access directly the [app online](https://lucie-kcz.shinyapps.io/tropicalisation/).

---

### 2. Advanced Use ‚Äî Run Full Analysis Manually

For users who want full control outside of the app:

- Navigate to the `analysis/` folder.
- Scripts are modular:
  - `compute_cti.R`: compute Community Temperature Index.
  - `compute_sti.r`: compute Species Thermal Indices.
  - `extract_temperatures.r`: link samples to SST.
  - `full_analysis.R`: run the entire CTI analysis pipeline from input data.
- SST handling scripts (`temperatures/R/`) are available if you want to recompute temperature rasters or extract SST from raw data.

## üìä Data Requirements

Your CSV file must include:

| Column      | Description                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| StationID   | Site or station identifier (text)            |

## üìú How the Code Works

1. **Species Thermal Index (STI)**: compute mean temperature across species occurrences.
2. **Community Temperature Index (CTI)**: weighted mean of species‚Äô STIs per community sample.
3. **Trend Analysis**: model CTI changes over time.
4. **Process Decomposition**: classify species trends into ecological processes.
5. **Outputs**: plots, maps, and trend tables.
